    % Initialises all variables, including:
    % * the number of atoms (N).
    % * the initial element populations (D-elements vector init_pop).
    % * the half life of each element that decays ((D-1)-elements vector
    % half_lives).
    % * Nâˆ’elements vector of the time grid where the population is
    % returned.
    % This function also calculates the analytic solution, and plots the
    % data produced by simulate_decay.m over the analytic solution.

    % Input: N/A
    
    % Output: Nothing is returned, but this function outputs the plot of
    % data (coloured lines) over the analytic solution (black dashed
    % lines).

    % Example use: N/A
